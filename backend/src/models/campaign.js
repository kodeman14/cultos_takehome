		// and because we're checking manually, we'd want a model called `userSocialAction`
		// a script ran manually would hit `/api/userSocialAction/create` with the `campaignID` and what `action` and `platform` the `userID` checked. This would increase campaign.$PLATFORM.$ACTION.totalRedemptions+=1
		// and create an instance of the `userSocialAction` with the `user`, `action`, `platform`, `userID` -- this would be used in user activity
		//       but how would we prevent the user from doing the action again? Filter the actions in the future by the ones aren't in `userSocialActions` for this action, cross ref
		// for counting number of participants, that would also be counted from the `userSocialAction` models that are created from the script
		// the script will add `totalRedemptions: +1` to the right action when it runs AND create the activity entry
		// this same script will need to update the AVE in a campaign
